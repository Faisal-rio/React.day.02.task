# React-Day-2 Price Card Task

In this project, I recreated a dynamic price card user interface using React.js and JSX. The task involved leveraging React's component-based architecture to build a responsive and visually appealing layout. Below are the key features and approaches used in this application:

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic User Interface**: The user interface was reproduced using React.js, showcasing the versatility of React in creating interactive web applications.

2. **Data Management**: An array of objects was utilized to manage the pricing data. This approach enables easy updates and maintenance of data without modifying the DOM structure.

3. **Dynamic Rendering with Map Method**: 
   - The `map()` method was employed to loop through the array of objects, dynamically creating elements for each price card. 
   - This method allows for efficient rendering of components by reusing the same structure and only changing the data passed to it.

4. **Component-Based Architecture**: 
   - Separate functional components were created to handle different aspects of the price card, promoting code reusability and separation of concerns.
   - Data was passed from the parent component to child components, allowing each price card to receive its unique properties.

5. **Responsive Design**: The application was styled to ensure a responsive layout, providing an optimal viewing experience across different devices.
